# Labyrinth search
Artificial intelligence course program for solving labyrinths. 

Vilnius University, 2020

# Algorithms
Depth-first recursive algorithm.

Breadth-first iterative algorithm.

There is space for implementing more algorithms.

# Logging
Program is enhanced with advanced logging and tracing in every step.

# Input
Current method of input is through file.

Examples are included in `Samples` folder.

Examples can also be found in the text book https://klevas.mif.vu.lt/~cyras/AI/ai-cyras.pdf
